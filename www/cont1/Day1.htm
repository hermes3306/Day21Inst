<p>In this meditation, Deepak Chopra gives an overview of the challenge and explains&nbsp;<strong>the reality of abundance</strong>, and how we can begin to open our eyes to the abundance that is already before us.</p>

<p>The centering thought for this meditation is:</p>
<p><strong>Today, I behold all of the abundance that surrounds me.</strong></p>
<p>As you work through the meditation, let go fo your thoughts, and begin to observe the breath, noticing how you become more relaxed with each breath.</p>
<p>You can use the&nbsp;<strong>so-hum mantra</strong>&nbsp;to deepen your relaxation and center yourself into a feeling of peace.</p>
<p>When you feel at peace, begin to think through the idea for the day: &ldquo;Today, I behold all of the abundance that surrounds me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The abundance meditations are made available through the Chopra Center.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Day 1</strong></h2>
<p>After you complete the task, please write to your group leader: &ldquo;Day 1 Done.&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>No more writing is necessary! &nbsp; You have 24 hours (plus a little leeway) to complete the task. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I highly recommend doing the meditation and the task at the beginning of the day, if possible.&nbsp; It changes the course of the day! &nbsp;</p>
<h2>*Task*</h2>
<p>&nbsp;In your new notebook,&nbsp;<strong>make a list of 50 people that have influenced your life.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>They can be both living and already departed people, your relatives, friends, and celebrities, writers and personalities whom you do not necessarily know personally. &nbsp;<br /><br />Everyone who has influenced you, and contributed to your growth &amp; development. &nbsp;<br /><br />The list must have at least 50 names. &nbsp;<br /><br />In the process of making a list,&nbsp;<strong>think about why you chose the person</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>What has changed in your life for the better?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong><br />Move calmly and thoughtfully.&nbsp;<br /><br />Remember the best things about each person on the list and what they bring into your life. &nbsp;<br /><br />Trust in the process! &nbsp;<br /><br />I recommend putting the phone in airplane mode at this time so that no one will interfere with you (children and everyone around you too ðŸ™‚ &ndash; as much as is realistic of course&nbsp;) &nbsp;<br /><br />Your list may be more than 50 people. But not less! &nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>PHRASE OF THE DAY:&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p><strong>* Today I behold the&nbsp;abundance&nbsp;that surrounds me *</strong></p>
<p>This should also be written in your notebook and remembered during the day as often as possible. &nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>This meditation can be done before or after the task. It&rsquo;s up to you!&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>This is the Mantra you will repeat during meditation:</strong></p>
<p><strong>So Hum</strong></p>
<p><strong>So Hum</strong></p>
<h2><strong>DAY 1 RECAP:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>1. Meditation: Listen to the audio. Repeat the mantra. &nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Write the phrase of the day in your notebook:&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;Today I behold all the&nbsp;abundance&nbsp;that surrounds me.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember it during the day. &nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Complete the assignment in a notebook &ndash;&nbsp;<strong>make a list of 50 people who have influenced your development. &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>4. I highly recommend staying on top of each daily task if possible. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Have a great evening and an even better day!!</p>
