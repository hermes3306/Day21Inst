<p>I am so happy for each one of you who are in this flow together. Thanks again for reaching out privately with questions, concerns, or just to reconnect. It&rsquo;s so nice to hear your individual voices and check in with each other.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />Find at least 5 receipts of recent purchases.</p>
<p>Write on each of them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All that is invested is good and will return to itself seven times&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Receipts can be of any type: supermarket, restaurant, personal items, car, health, hairdresser, entertainment, etc.</p>
<p>If your purchase receipts are electronic, you may create a paper receipt by writing the amount, date and to whom you paid on a piece of paper.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And from now on, on each purchase receipt that you receive, write this statement.</p>
<p>Remember, it&rsquo;s important not only what you write, but also how you write it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Words have power. They help your mind build new programming and therefore create a new reality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phrase:&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&ldquo;Through the law of pure potentiality, I can create anything anytime anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
