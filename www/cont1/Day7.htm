<p>Congratulations on completing the first week of The Chopra Center 21-day Meditation Challenge.<br /><br /><strong>Creating abundance</strong></p>
<p>Over the past six days we have discovered the reality and source of abundance which is unlimited and eternal we&rsquo;ve learned that mind matter.</p>
<p><strong>Dr.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Deepak says, &ldquo;Luck is a concept invented and used by those who have not yet discovered the incredible power of living in alignment with the soul-spirit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source once you realign with your source you will find that you can<br />spontaneously fulfill your desires!</strong>&rdquo;</p>
<p><br />Now that you&rsquo;re wired for success, here is another powerful meditation and task!&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Task*&nbsp;<br />Create a list of people that make you feel uncomfortable.&nbsp;<br /><br />This may include people from the list of the first day, i.e. those who have pushed you to grow and have brought something meaningful to your life.<br /><br />Here we are talking about the energy of discomfort.<br />It can be your relatives or people who are now far from you.<br /><br />Your litmus test here is a feeling of discomfort, &ldquo;I feel unpleasant.&rdquo;<br /><br />Including if it is not a constant feeling of communicating with this person.<br /><br />For example, it can be neighbors, employees, bosses, family members, members of the government.<br /><br />Remember that these people may trigger you, and at the same time, may also be your teachers or mentors.&nbsp;<br /><br />Woohoo!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
