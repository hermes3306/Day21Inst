<h2>&nbsp;*Task*</h2>
<p>It will seem simple to some people but not to others.</p>
<p>Remember that if it is difficult for you to perform any task, then it is clear that there is a block &ndash; an obstacle in your mind on the path towards attaining abundance.<br /><br />Be aware of this and STICK with it!&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Write all of your debts in your notebook.</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />Debt on a bank account, credit cards, loans, debts to individuals, court debts &ndash; all of your debts, of any kind.<br /><br />No need to record the amount, only to whom and for what.<br /><br />For example: a mortgage, a car loan, a debt to VISA for a gift to Tanya, etc.<br />And after that make a list of all your monthly payments.</p>
<p>Again without numbers, just listing.<br />For example: renting an apartment, electricity, gas, land tax, water, an accountant, a kindergarten, a music tutor, a gym, a manicure, insurance, gasoline, etc.</p>
<p>Everything you have to pay each month should be recorded.<br />In general, create a complete list of sources of your monthly expenses, constant and changing.</p>
<p>For some, this list will be extensive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Give yourself time to calmly walk through all the areas of your life in which you pay money. You may need to add what you remember even throughout the day.</p>
<h2>*Phrase*</h2>
<p>Write this phrase of the day in your notebook:&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>&ldquo;I create my personal abundance from an infinite source.&ldquo;</strong></p>
<p><strong>This is the Mantra you will repeat during meditation:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aham Bramasmi</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aham Bramasmi</strong></p>
<p>Answer the question,&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;What does abundance mean to you?&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>If you want, you can write the answer in your notebook.</p>
<p><strong>May the energy of abundance of this beautiful group continue to grow and fill us all!</strong></p>
<p>After you complete the task, please write &ldquo;Day 2 done.&rdquo;<br />Have a beautiful day! &nbsp;</p>
