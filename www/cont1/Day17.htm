<p>Welcome to Day 17!</p>
<p><strong>*Task:*</strong><br />Create a list of all the important things you have. Material, spiritual, emotional, etc.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>For example:</strong><br /><br />I have a smartphone to be in touch with the world<br />I have a real friendship</p>
<p>I have internetI</p>
<p>I have an affection for husband, &nbsp;wife or partner<br /><br />I have memoriesI<br /><br />I feel deeply joy for the movie &ndash; &ldquo;Princess Bride!&rdquo;<br /><br />There are no high or low limits in the things you can write down.&nbsp; Recognize everything you have that matters to you.<br /><br /><strong>*Motto:*</strong><br /><br />I lead my feelings and choose to feel whole, healthy, abundant and blessed.<br />Phrase:<br /><br />I move through my days lighthearted and care-free knowing all is well &rdquo;*</p>
<p><strong>*Mantra:*</strong></p>

<p><br /><strong>*Message:*</strong></p>
<p>Today we look at how we can live carefree &ndash; free from judgment and anxiety, focusing on the joy and perfection of what is right now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By meditating and plunging into the awareness of the present moment, you understand that it is at this moment, everything is perfect and is what it should be.And that any problems that you have are transient and temporary.</p>
<p>You reconnect with your True Self, feeling lighter and free.&nbsp;<br />Throughout life, you will begin to look at everyday circumstances easily and meet surprises calmly and with grace.</p>
<p>Question N &deg; 1: How do you feel when you wake up every morning?</p>
<p>Question &nbsp; N &deg; 2: How much would your life improve if you lived with a light and carefree heart?</p>
<p>Question &nbsp; N &deg; 3: How can you switch your mind to spread the love and joy that you feel in your heart right now?&ndash;</p>
<p>You make all things possible when connected to your heart and what beats it!&nbsp;</p>
