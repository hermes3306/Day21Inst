<p><strong>Day 11</strong><br /><br />Abundance and the Law of Least Effort</p>
<p><strong>*Message*&nbsp;</strong><br />In today&rsquo;s meditation, we will look at the Law of Least Effort and how it can support you in being unattached to the outcome of your deepest desires and intentions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When your actions are motivated by love, your energy is multiplied and accumulated.</p>
<p>The release of this energy allows you to redirect it and use it to create everything that you want to create.</p>
<p>When your spirit is your inner point of reference, all the power of love is at your disposal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And you can use this energy creatively, moving toward abundance and evolution.<br /><br /><strong>QUESTION &nbsp;N&deg; 1:&nbsp;</strong>According to your conviction, how hard should you work to enjoy true abundance?</p>
<p><br /><strong>QUESTION &nbsp; N&deg; 2:</strong>&nbsp;In what areas of your life would you like to get more abundance?<br /><strong>QUESTION &nbsp; N&deg; 3:&nbsp;</strong>What changes should you make to release your desires into the space of universal consciousness &ndash; the source of all abundance?</p>
<p><br /><strong>*Task:*<br /></strong>&nbsp;Please describe your mom in the notebook.<br />* positive aspects&nbsp;</p>
<p>* limitations&nbsp;</p>
<p>* what did you learn from her?&nbsp;</p>
<p>* What brought you together?&nbsp;</p>
<p>* What separated / distance you?</p>
<p>If your mother is no longer in this world, focus on her image, join her and write what rises in your memory and feelings.</p>
<p>For some, this will not be an easy task.</p>
<p>If this is the case &ndash; while doing it, try to distance yourself from the personal experiences you&rsquo;ve had with your mom.</p>
<p>See her as just a human, a woman living her own life.</p>
<p><strong>Phrase&nbsp;</strong><br />*&rdquo;I expect and accept abundance to flow easily to me&rdquo;*<br />*Mantra*<br />Om Daksham Nama</p>
<p>Have a beautiful day/evening&nbsp;</p>
