<p>I&rsquo;m so happy for you all for committing thus far and using these materials to tap welcome greater awareness and prosperity!<br /><br />Love you!<br /><br />*Task*</p>
<p>Make a list of people whom you consider to be prosperous in your family or environment.<br /><br />These are people you personally know and have access to. They have achieved their goals in life, all or in part, are happy, or are perceived by you as happy.<br /><br />Important! We are not talking only about financial prosperity, the obligatory component is the joy, the happiness that this person is experiencing!<br /><br />These can be people from the previous list.<br />How much does not matter, even two &ndash; is enough.<br /><br />Please remember, the more attention and reflection you give to these simple tasks, the greater the return.&nbsp;<br /><br />*Phrase*&nbsp;<br /><strong>From this moment forward, I invite unlimited abundance into my life.</strong></p>
