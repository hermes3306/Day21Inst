<h2>Day 13</h2>
<p><strong>Abundance and the Law of Detachment</strong></p>
<p>*Message:*</p>
<p>Today we will learn how to abandon a desire to get a certain result.<br />We will learn the Law of Detachment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Abundance comes in many forms. As long as you create through desires that benefit the whole world, you can get whatever you want.</p>
<p>Symbols of abundance: a big house, a new car or elaborate jewelry will bring waves of excitement into your life.&nbsp; And yet, these symbols may mean sacrificing the ocean for the sake of several transient waves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Live, overflowing with an abundance of love, passion, creativity and significance, and then these symbols themselves will &ldquo;chase&rdquo; you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ndash;Dr. David Simon, Co-Founder of the Chopra Center</p>
<p>QUESTION &nbsp; &nbsp;N&deg; 1: What symbols of abundance do you dream of?<br />QUESTION &nbsp; &nbsp;N&deg; 2: How could they improve both your life and others?<br />QUESTION &nbsp; &nbsp;N&deg; 3: How else will such abundance positively affect your life?&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Task:*</p>
<p>Think about your mom&rsquo;s description from Day 11.</p>
<p>Consider your life and your patterns of behavior. Do you see some similarities between you and your mom?</p>
<p>What are they, how were they formed?&nbsp;<br />Write these reflections in your notebook.</p>
<p>Listen to today&rsquo;s meditation twice in a row.<br />Have a wonderful day ( or evening ) everyone, full of light and abundance! &nbsp;</p>
