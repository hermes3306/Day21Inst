<p>Abundance and the Law of Intent and Desire</p>
<p><strong>*Message*&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Attention energizes; &nbsp;intention transforms.<br />In today&rsquo;s meditation, we will look at the Law of Intent and Desire.</p>
<p>Whatever you want or need in life can be programmed in the space &ldquo;computer.&rdquo; It has unlimited organizing power to work for you, clearly articulating the intention and throwing its seeds in the field of all possibilities.</p>
<p>Thus, you will attract the right people, as well as favorable situations and circumstances; which will help you in the manifestation and implementation of your desires.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION N &deg; 1:</strong>&nbsp;What is your highest intention in life?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION N &deg; 2:</strong>&nbsp;What can you do to make this happen?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION N &deg; 3:</strong>&nbsp;How will this intention best serve you and others?</p>
<p><strong>*Task:*</strong></p>
<p>Ask your mom what her biggest pain/disappointment has been in her life.&nbsp;<br />And, what is her dream -and/or great desire that remains unfulfilled?<br />Write the answer in your notebook.<br />If your mother is no longer with you or you are unable to ask her personally, go into a state of meditation, ask and listen to the answer.&nbsp; Write it down.</p>
<p><strong>Phrase:&nbsp;</strong><br />&nbsp;* I place my intention into the vast ocean of all possibilities and allow the universe to work through me&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>*Mantra*</strong><br />&nbsp;Om Mritham Nama&nbsp;<br />Om Mritham Nama</p>
