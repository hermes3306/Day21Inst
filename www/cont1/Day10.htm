<p>Welcome to Day 10</p>
<h2>*Task:*</h2>
<p>From yesterday, choose 2 things that limit you.&nbsp;<br />Establish a program for yourself by writing down at least 2 specific daily actions that &ldquo;fix&rdquo; the defect, reduce a deficiency, &nbsp;or realize that there is a plus side to this defect and start using it in to your advantage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After that, immediately begin to fulfill the intent of your program.&nbsp;<br />For example: If one is your flaws is being &ldquo;ungrateful,&rdquo; you can establish a daily journaling of writing down all of what you&rsquo;re grateful. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Phrase of the Day:&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p><strong>*&ldquo;Today I make great choices because they are made with full awareness&ldquo;*</strong></p>
<p>Write the phrase of the day in a notebook and keep it in your head, remembering and saying it as often as possible during the day.<br />Start as early as possible so that there is more opportunity to repeat the phrase of the day.</p>
<p><strong>In addition, listen to today&rsquo;s meditation at least 3 times.</strong></p>
<p><strong>*Mantra:*</strong></p>
<p>Om Kriam Nama</p>
<p><strong>*Message:*</strong></p>
<p>Abundance and the Law of Karma</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s meditation, we will discuss the Law of Karma, or conscious decision-making, and see how, by making the right choices, we can bring much more good into our lives.</p>
<p>When you make any choice, you may ask yourself: how will this choice bring more happiness and more abundance to my life and those around me?&nbsp; Having asked this question, shift your attention to the heart, and the answer will immediately become clear.</p>
<p>By practicing conscious decision-making in this way, you will learn to observe your thoughts and make decisions that are more favorable to you.</p>
<p>QUESTION N &deg; 1: How do you make decisions?</p>
<p>QUESTION N &deg; 2: How have your decisions affected your life?&nbsp;</p>
<p>QUESTION N &deg; 3: How can you make a more conscious choice?<br />Love&nbsp;</p>
