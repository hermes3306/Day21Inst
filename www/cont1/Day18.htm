<p>Day 18&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so happy for you all, and we are close to completion!</p>
<p><strong>*Task:*</strong></p>
<p>Write a letter to your country of origin.&nbsp; In this letter, express all your feelings about it.</p>
<p>Remember that all of your feelings are valid and appropriate.&nbsp; Write everything that arises.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I remind you, write down the meditation in your notebook and keep your attention on it throughout the day.&nbsp;&nbsp;Namaste.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Phrase:</strong><br />&nbsp;* I celebrate my unity with all life knowing we are all one *</p>
<p><br /><strong>*Mantra:*</strong><br />Tat Tham Asi&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tat Tuam Asi</p>
<p><br /><strong>*Message of the Day*</strong></p>
<p>Live in unity</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s meditation, we will talk about unity, as the basic truth of all that exists.</p>
<p>As individuals, we are not alike.&nbsp; We have different lifestyles, beliefs and perceptions.</p>
<p>However, these differences exist only in the physical plane.<br /><br />Whereas at the molecular and spiritual level, we are all one and are connected with the universal primary source.</p>
<p>When we begin to fully understand this concept of life in unity, the idea of a personal &ldquo;I&rdquo; gives way to the image of a universal &ldquo;I&rdquo;.<br />The concept of rivalry and competition disappears.&nbsp;<br />This relationship contributes to deep love and empathy for everyone who surrounds us.</p>
<p><br />QUESTION &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;N &deg; 1: How would you define unity?</p>
<p><br />QUESTION &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;N &deg; 2: What do you think of diversity?</p>
<p><br />QUESTION &nbsp; &nbsp;N &deg; 3: How did meditation help you realize the idea of living in unity?</p>
