<h3>Today I embrace my potential to be, do and have whatever I can dream.</h3>
<p>Day 5 practice and meditation!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take a deep breath, trust you have the time and resources to explore this invitation to share more abundance consciousness with the world! We have time for what we make time for! Love you</p>
<p>Day 5<br />Today&rsquo;s a GOOD ONE<br /><br /><strong>*Message of the Day*</strong><br /><br />Today we will penetrate the field of all possibilities, appearing in the silence of meditation.<br /><br />The unlimited power of the universe is always at your disposal.<br />By making intuitive decisions rooted in this unified field, you can express your deepest desires.<br /><br />In your everyday life, if possible, continue to cultivate silence.&nbsp; Spend more time in nature, soaking up her beauty and watching how abundance manifests itself everywhere.&nbsp;<br /><br />Immerse yourself in the energy of beautiful music; uplifting and inspiring stories; optimistic like-minded people around you.<br /><br />By doing this, you will see how the field of all possibilities is widely revealed in front of you to help your dreams come true.<br /><br /><strong>*Phrase*</strong><br />Today I embrace my potential to be, do and have whatever I can dream.<br /><br /><strong>*Mantra*</strong><br />Sat Chit Ananda<br />Sat Chit Ananda</p>
<p><strong>Today&rsquo;s task is based on the law of *energy exchange.*</strong><br /><br />Everything is made of energy.<br /><br />A person constantly exchanges energy with other people.<br />You are constantly changing your energy!<br /><br />The first principle of this law is that balance must be maintained in everything.<br /><br />If someone departed, then someone arrived.<br /><br />&nbsp;Energy does not disappear anywhere.<br /><br />If you sent something outside, then something will return to you.<br /><br />If you want to achieve a balance in everything, learn to give and receive equally.<br /><br />Today&rsquo;s exercise is completely devoted to the exchange, returns.&nbsp; And a turning point in our journey!&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>*The Task*</strong></p>
<p><strong>From today, you will be responsible for your OWN abundance group.</strong></p>

<p>It does not have to be big.&nbsp; Even 2-3 people is enough. Yes, enough easy!</p>
<p>Embrace your potential to be, do and have whatever you can dream.</p>
<p>Every day, you will conduct your group through tasks from 0 to 21 days, just like you get them from me and continue to receive.<br /><br /><strong>Today you are just creating your group.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>How do you open a group?&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Choose a profile photo that symbolizes abundance for you.</strong></p>
<p>Name the group &ldquo;21 Days of Abundance&rdquo; or other name and invite your friends.</p>
<p>It is important to explain the intention of the group and say that there will be daily tasks. Invite people from your contact list.</p>
<h3><strong>You were invited by me or someone that wants you to participate sent your name and number to my WhatsApp.</strong></h3>
<p>Invite everyone &ndash; I Invited everyone! Others invited their loved ones!</p>
<p>Do not decide for other people whether it will be interesting to them or not.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is this flow of plenty that they need now.&nbsp; And you will be the conductor of abundance in the lives of these people!</p>
<p>Potential participants must be prepared to become part of such a process.<br />Only those who are ready to follow you and change their consciousness will remain in your group.</p>
<p>Friends may drop out of your group and you may be inclined to convince them to stay. We do not persuade anyone. They are free to make their own choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember, you will need to send meditations and tasks every day and make sure that only those who perform the task remain in the group, maintain the group rules and the general flow.<br /><br />(Days 4 is where I begin clearing our group to give each person time to expand into the forces of the universe that want your visions and desires to be manifest!)</p>
<p>For some, Day 5 may seem difficult due to the extra effort that will have to be made, or because of fear of failure or fear of the unknown or the fear of &ldquo;how it looks.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It helps to realize one&rsquo;s fears, doubts, limitations that interfere with growth.<br />Believe me, it&rsquo;s easy to lead your group and very inspiring!</p>
<h3>You only need to<strong>&nbsp;<em>copy the messages</em>&nbsp;</strong><em>with a guided meditation</em>&nbsp;that I am sending you and check the progress of the tasks.</h3>
<p><br />You can add something from yourself &amp; remember to&nbsp;<strong>alter the days/due dates.</strong></p>
<p>If you do not know what to add, send my messages.&nbsp;<br /><br />I want to inspire you to continue because look at the community we are building.<br /><br />The energy exchange we are creating!&nbsp;</p>
<p>And judging by the notes, emails, and messages you have already seen this for yourself!</p>
<p>Let the love in your hearts expand, because you can contribute to the well-being of others!&nbsp;</p>
<p>The consciousness of abundance is guaranteed to you.</p>
<p>By creating and leading your group, you will receive an extraordinary resource!</p>
<p>IMPORTANT:</p>
<p><strong>You have 24 hours to open a group &ndash;</strong><br /><br />When you create your group, comment here &ldquo;Group Created.&rdquo;<br /><br />This will be the report on the fifth day, and tomorrow you will report in the usual form.<br /><br />Today there is no other written assignment other than rewriting the phrase of the day in a notebook.<br /><br />Tomorrow we will continue to work in the notebook.<br /><br /><strong>And that is how I started this group with you beautiful souls.</strong></p>
