<p>Day 6</p>
<p>Congratulations to you, you have created your own abundant groups! Woohoo!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now we enter what&rsquo;s called Operating Mode</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://mail.google.com/mail/e/2708" alt="?" /></figure>
<p>I recommend staying organized with your groups and remaining timely.</p>
<p>Observe the order and terms of assignments and use the original texts, updating the dates as appropriate.</p>
<p>Remember that we only transmit what we received ourselves!&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have questions about the conduct of your group, please text me in private. ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>We continue to work with our groups and begin the 6th day.</p>
<p><strong>*Task*</strong></p>
<p>Statement:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, (full name, last name), am starting a new relationship with money today.<br />Money is good, pure, useful and necessary for my prosperity and growth, for my satisfaction and abundance.</p>
<p>Money brings positive things to my life. The success that I experience in life brings me money and happiness, for me and my loved ones.</p>
<p>I deserve to flourish and have a lot of money.<br />Money is my friend and the value of my investments in it is growing every day.</p>
<p>Success and money accompany me, here and now.</p>
<p>I ask my parents, grandparents, and ancestors to the very origins of the tribe, who had difficulties due to lack of money, to bless me as I choose to live differently.</p>
<p>And I ask my parents, grandparents, and ancestors to inspire me to the very origins of the family, who lived in abundance and prosperity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Write this statement 10 times in your notebook by hand. If you have questions about the phrasing, reach out Personally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After that record yourself reading this statement with soul, expression and sense of attachment, i.e. sincerely, on audio or video.</p>
<p>This task is the longest in our journey, it can take about an hour. &nbsp;<br />Before performing &ndash; sit comfortably, relax, inhale several times slowly and deeply through the nose and exhale as slowly through the nose.</p>
<p>Our brain learns through repetition and rehearsal.<br />Therefore, tune in to connect with what you will write.</p>
<p>All of this is necessary to harmonize your internal relationship with money.</p>
<p>*<strong>Phrase*</strong></p>
<p><strong>Everyth</strong>ing I desire is within me!*</p>
<p><strong>*Mantra of the Day*</strong></p>
<p>Ram&hellip; ram&hellip; ram&hellip;<br />Ram&hellip; ram&hellip; ram</p>
<p>As a reminder, it is completely normal to experience discomfort and resistance to some tasks. This journey highlights your blocks and negative programming clearly so that you can see what is stopping you from living the abundant life that you desire.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You all are doing amazing!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep it up!! Have a wonderful day! Wishing you clarity -Welcome home to you!&nbsp;</p>
