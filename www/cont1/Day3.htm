<p>Day 3<br />Welcome to the third day! &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope your group and the daily exercises are inspiring and you are already seeing results or recognizing your blocks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;This day task is fun!<br />Please feel free to message me personally with your testimonials.&nbsp;<br /><br />*Task*<br />Draw notes, checks, stocks, bonds, coins, and any other means of payment in your beautiful notebook.<br /><br />Draw so much to pay off all the debts and expenses you wrote down yesterday. &nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://mail.google.com/mail/e/1f609" alt="?" /></figure>
<p>Now you have complete freedom to create and draw a solution.&nbsp; We draw in order to make it possible to pay for everything you need in the universe!<br />Use your imagination, your creativity and felt-tip pens, pencils or paints etc.<br />Draw bills, coins, wads of money, bags of money, rain of money &ndash; whatever you want!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember, this is not about a drawing lesson, but about allowing yourself to create your reality and let it manifest into your life.<br />While you are busy designing and coloring, feel the satisfaction of creating a balance between debts and expenses and the means of payment that you create &ndash; as if it were a real payment of your expenses and debts.<br />Have fun with it! &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;Phrase:<br /><strong>*Today I focus on what I want to attract into my life.*<br />*Mantra*</strong><br /><br /><strong>Sat Chit Ananda<br /><br />Sat Chit Ananda</strong></p>
<p>What is reality? Is it what we can experience with our senses or is it something else, something deeper?</p>
