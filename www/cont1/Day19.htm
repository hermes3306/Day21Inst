<p>Here is&nbsp;Day&nbsp;19!<br /><br />Read the parable below at least twice and then write down your thoughts and feelings in your notebook.<br /><br />Moreover, today&nbsp;<strong>SHARE in the group</strong><br />~ you are doing this challenge with<br />~or in the group you created &ndash; what is does the parable mean to you?<br /><br /><strong>Parable</strong><br /><strong>&ldquo;This too shall pass&rdquo;.</strong></p>
<p>There was a king and he once said to the court sages &ndash; I have a ring with one of the finest diamonds in the world and I want to hide a message under the stone that can be useful in a situation of extreme despair.&nbsp; I will give this ring to my heirs and I want it to serve faithfully.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think of what kind of message will be there.&nbsp; It must be very short to fit in the ring.<br />The sages knew how to write treatises, but did not express themselves in one short sentence.&nbsp; They thought and thought, but did not come up with anything.</p>
<p>The king complained about the failure of his venture to a faithful old servant who raised him from infancy and was part of the family.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the old man said to him:&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a sage, I&rsquo;m not educated, but I know such a message. For many years spent in the palace, I met a lot of people. And once I served a visiting mystic whom your father invited. And he gave me this message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ask that you don&rsquo;t read it now. Save it under the stone and open it only when there&rsquo;s no way out at all.&nbsp;The king listened to the old servant.<br />After some time, the enemies attacked the country and the king lost the war.&nbsp; He fled on his horse and his enemies pursued him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He was alone, his enemies were many. He rode to the end of the road.&nbsp; There was a huge deep cliff before him, if he fell there, it is the end.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He could not go back, as the enemies were approaching. He already heard the clatter of their horses&rsquo; hooves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He had no way out.&nbsp; He was in complete despair.<br />And then he remembered the ring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He opened it and found an inscription: &ldquo;This too shall pass&rdquo;</p>
<p>After reading the message, he felt that everything was quiet.&nbsp; Apparently the pursuers got lost and proceeded in the wrong direction. Horses were no longer heard.</p>
<p>The king was filled with gratitude to the servant and the unknown mystic. The words were powerful.&nbsp; He closed the ring.&nbsp; And set out on the road.&nbsp; He gathered his army and returned his state.</p>
<p>On the&nbsp;day&nbsp;when he returned to the palace, they arranged a magnificent meeting, a feast for the whole world &ndash; the people loved their king. The king was happy and proud.</p>
<p>An old servant came up to him and said softly: &ldquo;Even in this moment, look at the message again.&rdquo;<br /><br />The King said, &ldquo;Now I am a winner, people are celebrating my return, I&rsquo;m not in despair, not in a hopeless situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to this old servant,&rdquo; the servant answered. &ldquo;The message works not only in moments when everything is bad, but also in moments of victory.&rdquo;<br />The king opened the ring and read:&rdquo;This too shall pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And again he felt a silence fall over him, although he was in the midst of a noisy dancing crowd.&nbsp; His pride dissolved.&nbsp; He understood the message.&nbsp; He was a wise man.</p>
<p>And then the old man said to the king; &ldquo;Do you remember everything that happened to you? Nothing and no feeling is permanent. As night changes&nbsp;day, so moments of joy and despair replace each other. Accept them as the nature of things, as part of life&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Friends, today, after completing the task of this&nbsp;day, as usual, comment &ldquo;Day&nbsp;19&nbsp;Done&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But also look at the events in your life (both good and not so good) while considering the words of the parable &ldquo;This too shall pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then write here in the group what thoughts and feelings you have about the meaning of the parable.</p>
<p><strong>Phrase:</strong><br />*&rdquo;Today I remember to love everything and everyone I come into contact with&rdquo;*</p>
<p><strong>*Mantra:*</strong><br />Sat chit anandaSat chit Ananda<br />Have an abundant&nbsp;day/ evening!&nbsp;</p>
