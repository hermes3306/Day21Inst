<h3>Let&rsquo;s keep doing the work and creating abundance!&nbsp;</h3>
<p>*Message:*</p>
<p>Abundance and the Law of Dharma</p>
<p>Today we are completing the second week of the 21 day meditation program of the Chopra Center &ndash; KEY TO ABUNDANCE.</p>
<p>Over the past week, we have examined abundance in terms of the principles described in my book, The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success, from the Law of Pure Potentiality to the Dharma Law today.</p>
<p>When your life is full of true purpose, your dharma, or abundance, rushes toward you easily and effortlessly.</p>
<p>As the saying goes: &ldquo;Do what you love, the money will be.&rdquo;<br />It is not only about material wealth, but also about satisfaction, confidence, optimism, joy and abundance! And all of its manifestations that will come to you if you live your true purpose in life.</p>
<p>QUESTION &nbsp; N&deg; 1: What brings you the most joy?</p>
<p>QUESTION &nbsp; N&deg; 2: How do you feel this joy in your everyday life and in your current work?</p>
<p>QUESTION &nbsp; N&deg; 3: How can you approach a life full of joy, by living your Dharma or life&rsquo;s dream?</p>
<p>*Task:*&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enjoy this day, noticing the generous gifts of the world that surround us, seek us, and ask us to notice and accept them.</p>
<p>Seek, find, accept and give thanks for each of them.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, write down at least three paths / sources through which abundance has come to you today.</p>
<p>Even if it was something very small.</p>
<p>Watch this short video:<br /><a href="https://youtu.be/VVckUjjFYlM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://youtu.be/VVckUjjFYlM</a>.</p>
<p>Write down 3 cases when you deprived someone of the opportunity to learn his/her lesson.</p>
<p>Think of examples such as enabling a friend, or doing a task for a child instead of patiently helping or showing them how, etc. I&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phrase:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;There is a way I can fulfill my true purpose in life&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Mantra: *</p>
<p>Om Varunam Nama</p>
<p>Om Varunam Nama</p>
<p>Have a beautiful evening!</p>
