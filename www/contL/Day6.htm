<p>Day 6 - {{Today}}<br /><br />Welcome to Day 6!<br /><br />Please complete Day 6 by {{Day}} 11:59pm in your timezone.<br /><br />Don&rsquo;t forget when you complete the tasks, please write the message:<br /><br />&ldquo;Day 6 done&rdquo;<br /><br />1. Meditate 10-15, even 20 minutes if you have time. Repeat the Sanskrit mantra &ldquo;Ram... ram...ram&rdquo; when you feel distracting thoughts and hear noises. Focus your breathing in and breathing out.<br />2. **Statement:<br />- "I, (full name, last name), am starting a new relationship with money today.<br /><br />- Money is good, pure, useful and necessary for my prosperity and growth, for my satisfaction and abundance.<br /><br />- Money brings positive things to my life. The success that I experience in life brings money and happiness for me and my loved ones.<br />- I deserve to flourish and have a lot of money. Money is my friend and the value of my investments is growing every day.<br />- Success and money accompany me, here and now. I ask my parents, grandparents, and ancestors who had difficulties due to lack of money, to bless me as I choose to live differently.<br />- And I ask my parents, grandparents, and ancestors who lived in abundance and prosperity to inspire me.&rdquo;<br /><br />*Write above statement 10 times in your notebook by hand.<br />**After that, record yourself reading this statement with soul, expression and sense of attachment on audio or video. <br /><br />***This task is the longest in our journey, it can take about an *hour*. Before performing - sit comfortably, relax, inhale several times slowly and deeply through the nose and exhale as slowly through the nose.<br /><br />Our brain learns through repetition and rehearsal.<br /><br />Therefore, tune in to connect with what you will write.<br /><br />All of this is necessary to harmonize your internal relationship with money.<br /><br />3. PHRASE OF THE DAY: (write in notebook)<br /><br />* &ldquo;Everything I desire is within me!&rdquo; ðŸŒ¿<br /><br />Reminder:<br />As a reminder, it is completely normal to experience discomfort and resistance to some tasks (this one was definitely uncomfortable for me!)<br /><br />This journey highlights your blocks and negative programming clearly so that you can see what is stopping you from living the abundant life that you desire. <br /><br />Great job! Keep it up ðŸ’«ðŸŒŸðŸ’«</p>
