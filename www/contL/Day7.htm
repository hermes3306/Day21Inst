<p>Day 7 - {{Today}}<br /><br />Welcome to Day 7!<br /><br />Please complete Day 7 by {{Day}} 11:59pm in your timezone.<br /><br />Don&rsquo;t forget when you complete the tasks, please write the message:<br /><br />&ldquo;Day 7 done&rdquo;<br /><br />1. Meditate 10-15, even 20 minutes if you have time. Repeat the Sanskrit mantra &ldquo;Sat Chit Ananda, Sat Chit Ananda&rdquo; when you feel distracting thoughts and hear noises. Focus your breathing in and breathing out.<br />2. Here we are talking about the energy of &ldquo;discomfort.&rdquo; *^*Create a list of people who make you feel uncomfortable<br />- This may include people from the list on the first day i.e. those who have pushed you to grow and have brought something meaningful to your life.<br />- It can be your relatives or people who are now far from you.<br />- Your litmus test here is a feeling of discomfort or unpleasantness, including someone you feel you aren't always communicating (talk to, interact, visit) with, personally or professionally. Examples: neighbours, employees, bosses, family members, members of the government.<br />- Remember that these people may &ldquo;trigger&rdquo; (a cause of certain emotional response, usually negative ones) you and at the same time they may also be your teachers or mentors. <br /><br />3. PHRASE OF THE DAY: (write in notebook)<br />pa<br />* "I use my conscious intention to manifest my dreams!&rdquo; 🌿<br /><br />🌺🌷🌸Namaste~🍃</p>
