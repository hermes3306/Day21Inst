<p>{{DayN}}: {{Today}}<br /><br />Please complete {{DayN}} by {{Day}} 11:59pm in your timezone.<br /><br />Don&rsquo;t forget when you complete the tasks, please write the message:<br /><br />&ldquo;{{DayN}} done&rdquo;<br /><br />It may seem simple to some people but not to others. Take your time, don&rsquo;t overthink and just do your best...<br /><br />Remember, if the task seems difficult for you to complete, any task, there is a block - an obstacle in your mind on the path towards attaining/attracting (like magnets to metal) abundance. <br /><br />Just be aware of this and &ldquo;stick with it&rdquo; (keep it up, don&rsquo;t give up)! You can do this!<br /><br />1. Meditate 10-15 minutes <a href="https://youtu.be/1ZYbU82GVz4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://youtu.be/1ZYbU82GVz4</a><br /><br />2. Write all of your debts in your notebook: <br />- a. Debt on a bank loan, credit cards, car loans, mortgage, personal loans, debts to individuals - all of your debts of any kind.<br /><br />* *DO NOT record the amount*, only who is owed and for what. For example:<br /><br />* Finance company - mortgage<br />* Car manufacturer - car loan<br />* Credit cards<br />* Father - loan to me for children&rsquo;s academy fees<br /><br />- b. After that make a list of all your monthly payments. *Not the KRW amount, just the &ldquo;type&rdquo; of monthly payments. No numbers, like the following:<br /><br />- rent or mortgage<br />- Car loan<br />- electricity<br />- gas<br />- water<br />- accountant<br />- School fees<br />- gym<br /><br />- This list you are creating, is a complete list of &ldquo;sources&rdquo; of your monthly expenses, constant and changing. For some, this list will be &ldquo;extensive&rdquo; (large, long). <br /><br />- Give yourself time to calmly walk through all the areas of your life in which you pay money. You may need to add what you remember &ldquo;throughout&rdquo; the day. <br />3. PHRASE OF THE DAY: (write in notebook)<br /><br />* &ldquo;I create my personal abundance from an &ldquo;infinite&rdquo; (related to &infin;) source.<br /><br />4. Answer the question, &ldquo;What does abundance mean to me?&rdquo;<br /><br />~ namaste ~</p>
