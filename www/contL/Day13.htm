As long as you create through desires that benefit the whole world, you can get whatever you want.<br /><br />Symbols of abundance: a big house, a new car or elaborate jewellery will bring waves of excitement into your life. And yet, these symbols may mean sacrificing the ocean for the sake of several transient waves.<br /><br />"Live, overflowing with an abundance of love, passion, creativity and significance, and then these symbols themselves will &ldquo;chase&rdquo; you."<br /><br />--Dr. David Simon, Co-Founder of the Chopra Center<br /><br />QUESTION 1: What symbols of abundance do you dream of?<br /><br />QUESTION 2: How could they improve both your life and others?<br /><br />QUESTION 3: How else will such abundance positively affect your life?</p>
