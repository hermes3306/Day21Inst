<p>Day 5 - {{Today}}<br /><br />Welcome to Day 5! It&rsquo;s already Day 5 of our practice and meditation! üëèüèΩ<br /><br />Please complete Day 5 by {{Day}}, 11:59pm in your timezone.<br /><br />Don&rsquo;t forget when you complete all the tasks, please write the message:<br /><br />&ldquo;Day 5 done&rdquo;<br /><br />Today is &ldquo;a biggie but a goodie&rdquo;! <br /><br />*^*Take a deep breath and trust you have the time and resources to explore this invitation to share more abundance consciousness with the world. We have time for what we make time for!<br /><br />Today's second task is based on the law of *energy exchange.*<br /><br />1. Meditate 10-15, even 20 minutes if you have time. Repeat the Sanskrit mantra &ldquo;Sat Chit Ananda, Sat Chit Ananda&rdquo; when you feel distracting thoughts and hear noises. Focus on your breathing in and breathing out.<br />2. From today, you will be responsible for your OWN abundance group.<br />- It does not have to be a large group. Even 2-3 people is enough.<br />- Every day, you will conduct your group through tasks from 0 to 21 days, just like you get them from me and continue to receive.<br />- Today you are just creating your group and sending task 0 in it (like I sent you just before we started). Start your group's "Day 1" on Monday.<br />- How do you open a group? <br />- Choose a profile photo that symbolizes abundance for you.<br />- Name the group "21 Days of Abundance" or other name and invite your friends.<br />- It is important to explain the intention of the group and say that there will be daily tasks.<br />- Invite people from your contact list.<br />- Especially invite people whose interest you question. Do not decide for other people whether it will be interesting to them or not.<br />- Perhaps it is this &ldquo;flow of plenty&rdquo; that they need now. And you will be the &ldquo;conductor&rdquo; of abundance in the lives of these people!<br />- Potential participants must be prepared to become part of such a process.<br />- Friends may drop out of your group and you may be inclined to convince them to stay but don't &ldquo;persuade&rdquo; anyone. They are free to make their own choice. <br />- Remember, you will need to send meditations and tasks every day and make sure that only those who perform the task remain in the group. It's your job to maintain the group rules and the &ldquo;general flow.&rdquo;<br />- For some, this task may seem difficult due to the extra effort that will have to be made, or because of fear of failure, or fear of the unknown or the fear of how it looks.<br />- It helps to realize one&rsquo;s fears, doubts and limitations that interfere with growth.<br />- It&rsquo;s easy to lead your group and is very inspiring (I promise!)<br />- You only need to copy the messages that I am sending you. You can add something yourself and remember to alter the days/due dates where needed. If you do not know what to add, just send my messages, then forward the audio.<br />- &hearts;Let the love in your hearts expand, because you can &ldquo;contribute&rdquo; to the &ldquo;well-being&rdquo; of others ü§ó<br />- IMPORTANT: Ideally do this by Friday night/Saturday morning at midnight, at the latest by Saturday night.<br />- When you create your group, comment here "Group Created"<br />- This will be the report on the Day 5 and on Day 6 you will report in the usual format.<br />- This is how our group started and it's beautiful to share our journey together! ü•∞<br /><br />3. PHRASE OF THE DAY: (write in notebook)<br /><br />* &ldquo;Today I embrace my potential to be, do and have whatever I can dream.&rdquo; üåø<br /><br />~Message of the Day~<br /><br />&ldquo;The unlimited power of the universe is always at your disposal.<br /><br />In your everyday life, spend more time in nature, soaking up her beauty and watching how abundance manifests itself everywhere. Immerse yourself in the energy of beautiful music; uplifting and inspiring stories; optimistic like-minded people around you.<br /><br />By doing this, you will see how the field of all possi
