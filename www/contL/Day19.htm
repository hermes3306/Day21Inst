For many years spent in the palace, I met a lot of people. And once I served a visiting mystic whom your father invited. And he gave me this message. I ask that you don&rsquo;t read it now. Save it&nbsp;under the stone and open it only when there&rsquo;s no way out at all.&rdquo;<br /><br />The king listened to the old servant.<br /><br />After some time, the enemies attacked the country and the king lost the war. &nbsp;He fled on his horse and his enemies pursued him. &nbsp;He was alone, his enemies were many. He rode to the end of the road. &nbsp;There was a huge, deep cliff before him; if he fell there, it would be the end. &nbsp;He could not go back, as the enemies were approaching. He already heard the clatter of their horses' hooves. He had no way out. &nbsp;He was in complete despair.<br /><br />And then he remembered the ring. &nbsp;He opened it and found an inscription: &ldquo;This too shall pass&rdquo;.<br /><br />After reading the message, he felt that everything was quiet. Apparently the pursuers got lost and proceeded in the wrong direction. Horses were no longer heard.<br /><br />The king was filled with gratitude to the servant and the unknown mystic. The words were powerful. &nbsp;He closed the ring and set out on the road. &nbsp;He gathered his army and returned to his state.<br /><br />On the day when he returned to the palace, they arranged a magnificent meeting, a feast for the whole world - the people loved their king. The king was happy and proud.<br /><br />The old servant came up to him and said softly: &ldquo;Even in this moment, look at the message again.&rdquo;<br /
