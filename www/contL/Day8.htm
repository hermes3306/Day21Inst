Meditate 10-15, even 20 minutes if you have time. Repeat the Sanskrit mantra &ldquo;Om Bhavam Namah, Om Bhavam Namah&rdquo; when you feel distracting thoughts and hear noises. Focus your breathing in and breathing out.<br />2. Find at least 5 receipts of recent purchases. *Write on each of them:<br />- "All that is invested is good and will return to itself seven times"<br />- Receipts can be of any type: supermarket, restaurant, personal items, car, health, hairdresser, entertainment, gifts, etc. If your receipts are electronic, you may create a paper receipt by writing the amount, date and to whom you paid on a piece of paper.<br />- ...and if you choose, continue to do this on each receipt from a purchase.<br />- Remember, it&rsquo;s not only important what you write, but also how you write it. <br />- Words have power. They help our mind build new programming and therefore create a new reality.<br /><br />3.
