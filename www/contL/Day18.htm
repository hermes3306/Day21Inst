We are almost done! 💫<br /><br />Please complete Day 18 by {{Day}} 11:59pm in your timezone.<br /><br />Don&rsquo;t forget when you complete the tasks, please write the message:<br /><br />&ldquo;Day 18 done&rdquo;<br /><br />1. *Please see &ldquo;Message of the Day&rdquo; below.* Meditate 10-15, even 20 minutes if you have time. Repeat the Sanskrit mantra &ldquo;Tat Twam Asi, Tat Twam Asi&rdquo; when you feel distracting thoughts and hear noises. Focus your breathing in and breathing out.<br />2. Write a letter to your country of origin. In this letter, express all your feelings about it.<br />- Remember that all of your feelings are valid and appropriate. Write everything that arises.<br />- *As a reminder, write down the meditation in your notebook and keep it in mind throughout the day. <br /><br />3. PHRASE OF THE DAY: (write in notebook)<br /><br />* "I celebrate my unity with all life knowing we are all one" 🌿<br />- Write the phrase of the day in a notebook and keep it in your head, remembering and saying it as often as possible during the day.<br />- Start early so there is more opportunity to repeat the phrase throughout your day.<br />- I lead my feelings and choose to feel whole, healthy, abundant and blessed.<br /><br />🌺🌷🌸Namaste~🍃<br /><br />~Message of the Day~<br /><br />~Attention energizes; intention transforms~<br /><br />Live in unity<br /><br />In today's meditation, we will talk about unity, as the basic truth of all that exists.<br /><br />As individuals, we are not alike. We have different lifestyles, beliefs and perceptions.<br /><br />However, these differences exist only in the physical plane.<br /><br />Whereas at the molecular and spiritual level, we are all one and are connected with the universal primary source.<br /><br />When we begin to fully understand this concept of life in unity, the idea of ​​a personal &ldquo;I&rdquo; gives way to the image of a universal &ldquo;I&rdquo;. (I - 저요)<br /><br />The concept of rivalry and competition disappears. <br /><br />This relationship contributes to deep love and empathy for everyone who surrounds us.<br /><br />QUESTION No 1: How would you define unity?<br /><br />QUESTION No 2: What do you think of diversity?<br /><br />QUESTION No 3: How did meditation help you realize the idea of ​​living in unity?<br /><br />Have a wonderful day~🌺</p>
