<p>Day 11 - {{Today}}<br /><br />Welcome to Day 11! Congrats...you&rsquo;re halfway there! 🚀<br /><br />Please complete Day 11 by {{Day}}11:59pm in your timezone.<br /><br />Don&rsquo;t forget when you complete the tasks, please write the message:<br /><br />&ldquo;Day 11 done&rdquo;<br /><br />1. *Please see &ldquo;Message of the Day&rdquo; below.* Meditate 10-15, even 20 minutes if you have time. Repeat the Sanskrit mantra &ldquo;Om Kriam Nama, Om Kriam Nama.&rdquo; when you feel distracting thoughts and hear noises. Focus your breathing in and breathing out.<br />- In addition, listen to today's meditation at least 3 times.<br />2. Please describe your mother in your journal.<br />* Positive aspects<br />* Limitations<br />* What did you learn from her?<br />* What has brought you together?<br />* What has separated/distanced you?<br />- If your mother is no longer in this world, focus on her image, join her and write what rises in your memory and feelings.<br />- For some, this will not be an easy task. If this is the case - while doing it, try to distance yourself from the personal experiences you've had with your mother. See her as just a human, a woman living her own life.<br /><br />3. PHRASE OF THE DAY: (write in notebook)<br /><br />* "I expect and accept abundance to flow easily to me." 🌿<br />- Write the phrase of the day in a notebook and keep it in your head, remembering and saying it as often as possible during the day.<br />- Start early so there is more opportunity to repeat the phrase throughout your day.<br /><br />🌺🌷🌸Namaste~🍃<br /><br />~Message of the Day~<br /><br />Abundance and the Law of Least Effort<br /><br />In today's meditation, we will look at the Law of Least Effort and how it can support you in being unattached to the outcome of your deepest desires and intentions. <br /><br />When your actions are motivated by love, your energy is multiplied and accumulated.<br /><br />The release of this energy allows you to redirect it and use it to create everything that you want to create.<br /><br />When your spirit is your inner point of reference, all the power of love is at your disposal. And you can use this energy creatively, moving toward abundance and evolution.<br /><br />QUESTION No 1: According to your conviction, how hard should you work to enjoy true abundance?<br /><br />QUESTION No 2: In what areas of your life would you like to get more abundance?<br /><br />QUESTION No 3: What changes should you make to release your desires into the space of universal consciousness - the source of all abundance?</p>
